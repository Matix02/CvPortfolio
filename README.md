# CvPortfolio[In Progress] 
A web application where I introduce myself as a strong programmer. Application made in HTML5/CSS3 and Javascript with a bit of Node.js.
Hosting - because it's on hosting - Firebase to check at any time (link below). The application is responsive for any mobile device. My porfolio CV application was built as a Single Web Application.

Bugs to fix:
- White block on the right in the lowest resolution
- Lack of Content - there is a lot of blank space for real text - "lorem ipsum"
- Category in About Me section - an old model for that type of content
